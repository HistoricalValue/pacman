* Remove useless collision checkings (add bool about whether it should check and move the point where amc (after move callback) is called.
* Tend all TODOs in the code.

* Consider removing platform member obstacle sprites from sprite holder (check ChangeLog of revision 16)

* Fix top and bottom wall containers which are not accurate sprites that they exeed the graphic to the right 

* Add configurable (upon build? defined? // dynamic configurable) limits for types of sprites (game, obstacle, ghost, more to come??)

* Move ghosts into lair and set up waypoints to allow them to get out and not get in again and all these
