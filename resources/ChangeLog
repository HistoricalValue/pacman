	* SUCCESS

- Side-effects : 
	* none

- Interface chages : additions
	* ObstaclePlatformHolder :
		(displayPlatforms) : new function.

- New bugs : 
	* none

* ObstaclePlatformHolder.hpp :
	(displayPlatforms) : new function.
* ObstaclePlatformHolder.cpp :
	(parseLine) : 
		* Added push back to sprite_data vector.
		* it now sets the visibility of platform member obstacle
		sprites to false in order to avoid drawing by the sprite
		holder (considering removing them from the holder -- discuss
		with team).
	(displayPlatforms) : new function.

* sakutest.cpp :
	(main) : added call to displayPlatforms.
* sakutest_setup.cpp :
	(setUpCollisions) :
		* Commented out manual adding of obstacle sprites in the
