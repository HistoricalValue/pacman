Readmes suck.

Dear co-developers,

There has been a year that we have been developing pacman now (we started
2006) and I would like to thank yo for this wonderful cooperation.

As you might now our development group recently migrated to a new 
development strategy: we begun to use Bazaar.

Bazaar has some wonderful features which I hope you will learn by time.
There will be seminars. 

For the time being you are not allowed to make any more changed (in other
words : changed will not be accepted) unless the follow the bazaar 
scheme. 

Have a nice happy new year.

Yours sincerely,
Saku.
